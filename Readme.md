# Readme File - 'Getting and Cleaning Data' Course Project
# Part of Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera 

## Background and Scope

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Peer assesment is based on a series of yes/no questions related to the project.

The following items have been completed and uploaded as required:

1. a tidy data set by the name of [tidyset.txt](https://github.com/irtizak/GetCleanDataProject/blob/master/tidydata.txt) 
2. a link to a [Github repository](https://github.com/irtizak/GetCleanDataProject) with the [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/irtizak/GetCleanDataProject/blob/master/run_analysis.R) script file for performing the analysis, and 
3. a [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/irtizak/GetCleanDataProject/blob/master/CodeBook.md) that describes the variables (where required), the data, and the work performed to clean up the data. 
4. a README.md (you're reading it! ;D) in the repo.
